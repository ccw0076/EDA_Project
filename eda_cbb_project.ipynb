    "To find answers to the given question, \"Which statistics best explain why certain teams win more games?\", I first computed the correlations between each team stat and the teams win percentage. The first iteration of my graph included W, L, and W-L% but these factors directly showed wins and loses so I removed these from the analysis. This left the remaining numerical statistics which revealed certain factors as positive and negative associations with winning. For example, turnovers correlated negatively with win percentage and SRS (simple rating system), FG%, and total points scored all correlated positively. This shows that both offense and defense performance play a large role in helping a team succeed. \n",

The first graph includes the 2020-2021 season and the second graph does not. I did this to show that the 2020-2021 season is an outlier due to the Covid-19 and the modified schedules. The second graph disregards the 2020-2021 season to show the more accurate trends across seasons. Additionally, I used the number of field goals and 3 pointers made instead of the percentage so that the lines on the graph were visable. At first I used the percentage and since some of the other values are so large the percentages looked like they were zero. These adjustments to the data/plots helped me draw concslusions about the trends over time. \n",

Additionally, the end of the 2019-2020 season was the begining of Covid-19 which explains the slight decrease in overall averages. The lasting effect of the Covid-19 seasons is also shown by the effect of the 2021-2022 season. The leagues average in points scored is lower than 2015-2019 which could show the effect a season off/modified had on players and coaches. Additionally, turnovers have been showing a slight declone which could indicate improvements in ball handling and focus on offensive preparation. These factors can point towards the game moving towards a more offensive focused game that emphasizes higher scoring and more shot attempts versus defensive stops. "

    "To explore whether teams in the SEC have distinct “statistical signatures,” I made a new dataframe only with the teams in the SEC conference. Then I computed the average in each of the given columns for all of the teams and standardized the findings using a z-score. I used z-scores and a heat map because the statistics beinf used vary highly in their values, for example, point sper season is in the thousands and blocks are around 50-150 per team. By using z-scores that allows us to compare these values realtively. The plot above highlights teams strengths and weaknesses relative to the average for the SEC conference. For example, Kentucky is well above the SEC averages for points scored, field goal percentage, total rebounds, assists, blocks, and SRS. Kentucky is a historically well established basketball school and this evidence proves there dominance in the SEC. Auburn is very middle of the pack based on this graph. in many of the categories Auburn is at average or very close to average. Some of the areas Auburn does best in include 3 point attempts and makes and some areas for improvement include field goal percentage, free throws, and turnovers. This plot highlights the meaningful differences between the way teams in the SEC play. This could be a helpful guide for coaches and players to see where their team excels and where improvements can be focused. "

    "To explore any outlier seasons overall and any outlier teams in the 2024-2025 season I used z-scores and the net points scored. The net points scored took the total points scored by a team and subtracted the points scored against them. Then using a z-score standardized the data set and allowed me to detect which teams where outliers. Overall, between each season there are lots of outliers on both ends of the spectrum. This speaks to basketball being a very dynamic and ever changing sport. It also shows how most teams stay within the average variance while some teams are truly outliers in either direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I decided to take a closer look in a specific season and I choose the past season, 2024-2025. I used the same process to find the z-scores and compare which teams had large point differnetial. As shown above Duke, UC San Diego, Florida, and even Auburn had seasons above the average. This makes sense as mos of the teams showing this outlier behavior played in the March Madness NCAA tournament. On the other end of the spectrum we can see that various teams underperformed this season and had more points scored against them and where also deemed as outliers. "
